# The project is a complete help system for 'Sensei' project.

Please use the 'inject.js' and 'frame.js' scripts.

The first should be included in the source of the angular app.

The second one should be in the 'build/' directory as it is looked up and
expectd to be there - it will be loaded in an iframe to provide the help
texts.
